## Forking a Repository

**What is Forking?**

Forking a repository creates a copy of an existing repository under your own account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

**How to Fork a Repository:**

1. **Navigate to the repository:**
   - Open your web browser and go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub.

2. **Click the Fork button:**
   - Look for the "Fork" button, usually located in the top-right corner of the repository page. Click it.

3. **Choose the owner:**
   - Select the account where you want to create the forked repository. This is usually your personal account.

4. **Wait for the fork to complete:**
   - GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your account. This process may take a few moments.

**Once the fork is complete, you will have a copy of the repository in your account. You can now make changes to your copy without affecting the original repository.**

**Additional Tips:**

- **Keep your fork updated:** If the original repository has updates, you can merge them into your fork by creating a pull request.
- **Use descriptive names:** When creating your fork, give it a descriptive name to easily identify it.
- **Collaborate with others:** You can invite collaborators to your fork to work on the project together.

**By following these steps, you can easily create your own copy of a repository and start making your own contributions.**
